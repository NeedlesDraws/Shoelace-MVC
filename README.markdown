ShoelaceMVC 2.0 (The SaaS Edition)
==================

Software as a Service (SaaS) Starter Project Template for ASP.NET MVC
-----
Developers are one of the few people that can build a product out of nothing and start a 
business with with just their computer and some free time.  ShoelaceMVC aims to be a project template for
a new generation of software.  Based on the VS2013 ASP.NET project tempalte, it adds additional features like
tenant accounts, subdomain and vanity domain routing per-tenant, and other tools that let you focus on building your product
and not your infrastructure. For best results, use along with Windows Azure to add on-demand scaling in the cloud and you've
got yourself a recipe for building an incredibly solid product. Go build your app and let ShoelaceMVC lay the groundwork!

Getting Started
-------

ShoelaceMVC started in 2011 as a starter kit that used Twitter's Bootstrap framework 
(including compliant scaffolding) and a CodeFirst Membership provider.  It was  great, but in VS2013, the default
project template is nearly identical in funtionality as ShoelaceMVC was.  In essence, it was obsolete.
When starting with the SaaS 2.0 version of ShoelaceMVC, look in the ShoelaceMVC-SaaS-Multitenant folder.  Once the SaaS project
itself gets in a state that's awesome and great, it'll be gutted as an actual VS Project Template.  Unfortunately,
VS Project Templates are really slow to add new features and test and pull back into a template because of all the search/replace
that has to happen for namespaces and things, so that may be a month or two down the road.  In the meantime, check out 
the project and file bugs or send a pull request! :D
